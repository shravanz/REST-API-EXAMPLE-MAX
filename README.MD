This repository accompanies on building a RESTful API with Node.js: [https://github.com/shravanz/REST-API-EXAMPLE-MAX](https://github.com/shravanz/REST-API-EXAMPLE-MAX)

## Usage
Check out the branch you're interested in (i.e. which belongs to the video in my series you just watched), ```git clone``` it and thereafter run ```npm install```.

Make sure to also add your Mongo Atlas Admin Username to a nodemon.json file (which you have to create).

```
{
    "env": {
        "MONGO_ATLAS_PW": "YOUR_MONGO_USER_PW"
    }
}
```
